# ROAD_ACCIDENT_PREVENTION_FINAL_THESIS

## Introduction
Road conditions play a critical role in ensuring the safety of drivers. By leveraging deep learning techniques, this project aims to classify road conditions accurately and in real-time. The approach uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to process images of roads and categorize them into three distinct classes:
### •	Severely Risky
### •	Mildly Risky
### •	Normal

## Features
**•	High Accuracy:** Achieved an accuracy of 95.5% in detecting problematic road conditions. 🏆

**•	Real-time Data Collection:** Implemented a mobile application that enables real-time crowdsourced data collection. 📱

**•	Community Sharing:** Facilitates sharing of road condition information among users. 🌍

**•	Model Updates:** Utilizes crowdsourced data to update the trained model, enhancing classification accuracy over time. 🔄

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluating the model comprises a variety of road images labeled into the three categories mentioned above. The data collection process is facilitated through the mobile application, ensuring diverse and up-to-date inputs.

## Model
The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a deep learning architecture well-suited for image classification tasks. The training process involves:
1.	Preprocessing the images. 🖼️
2.	Training the CNN model on the labeled dataset. 🧠
3.	Evaluating the model's performance. 📊
4.	Updating the model using new data collected via the mobile application. 🔄

## Mobile Application
The mobile application is a crucial component of the system, enabling users to:

•	Collect and upload road condition images in real-time. 📸

•	View and share road condition updates. 📡

•	Receive notifications about hazardous road conditions. 🚨
